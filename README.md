Nixbot
======

The cutest merge assistant in all of nixpkgs.

This bot will merge pull requests if asked nicely by someone who is listed as a
maintainer for the files the pull request changes.

It reads from a simple JSON file containing each maintainer and a list of the
approximate paths of packages they maintain:

```json
{
  ...
    "goibhniu": [
        "pkgs/applications/audio/synthv1/*",
        "pkgs/os-specific/linux/xf86-input-wacom/*",
        "pkgs/development/libraries/frei0r/*",
        "pkgs/applications/audio/fluidsynth/*",
        "pkgs/development/libraries/aubio/*",
        "pkgs/applications/audio/jalv/*",
        "pkgs/applications/audio/sonic-visualiser/*",
        "pkgs/development/tools/selenium/chromedriver/*",
        "pkgs/applications/video/key-mon/*",
        "pkgs/development/libraries/mlt/*",
        "pkgs/servers/http/yaws/*",
        "pkgs/development/libraries/libgig/*",
  ...
```

This list was auto generated by the `generate-maintainer-paths` script, which
simply runs `git grep <maintainer name>` and checks the word `maintainer` and
`default.nix` appears on the line.
